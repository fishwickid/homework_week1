Changes I made in this document were as follows...

1. Added a site title in the header that was more descriptive of what the company does. 

2. Added semantics tags to make it more organised for the browser to read, ultimately improving page SEO.

3. Removed un-needed ID tags.

4. Names sections so links worked properly.

5. Added Alt tags to the images making them readable to the browser.

6. Consolidated the CSS elements which had the same styling.

7. Added notes to the HTML to help understand the structure at a glance. 

8. Added a CSS reset sheet.
